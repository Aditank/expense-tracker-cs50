# Expense Tracker & Financial Insights System

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNXpRNH3-gY

#### Description:

The Expense Tracker & Financial Insights System is a web-based application built using Python and Flask that automates the process of tracking and analyzing personal financial transactions. The motivation behind this project was the inefficiency and error-proneness of manually tracking expenses using spreadsheets or notes. This project allows users to upload bank statement data in CSV format, automatically categorize transactions, store them securely, and generate financial summaries along with downloadable Excel reports.

The application includes a basic user authentication system that allows users to register and log in. Each user’s financial data is stored separately in a SQLite database, ensuring that uploaded transactions and generated reports are associated only with the logged-in user. Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug before being stored in the database.

Once a user uploads a CSV file, the application processes the data using the pandas library. Each transaction is categorized using a rule-based approach that matches keywords in the transaction description to predefined categories such as Food, Transport, Shopping, Utilities, Income, and Other. This approach was chosen to keep the logic transparent, explainable, and within the scope of the course.

After categorization, the application stores the processed transactions in a SQLite database and performs SQL queries to calculate total income, total expenses, and a category-wise breakdown of expenses. These results are displayed on a results page in the browser. In addition, the application generates an Excel report containing all transactions and a summarized expense sheet, which can be downloaded by the user.

#### Files and Their Purpose:

- **app.py**
  The main Flask application file. It handles routing, user authentication, CSV file uploads, data processing, database interactions, and rendering HTML templates.

- **database.py**
  Contains all database-related logic, including table creation, inserting transactions into the SQLite database, and executing SQL queries to generate financial summaries.

- **categorizer.py**
  Implements rule-based logic to categorize transactions based on keywords found in the transaction description.

- **analysis.py**
  Converts SQL query results into a format suitable for display and export, using pandas DataFrames.

- **templates/**
  Contains HTML files used by the Flask application, including pages for user login, registration, CSV upload, and displaying financial summaries.

- **data/sample_data.csv**
  A sample CSV file used for testing the application.

- **expense_report.xlsx**
  The Excel report generated by the application, containing both detailed transactions and summarized expense data.

#### Design Decisions:

A rule-based categorization system was chosen instead of a machine learning approach to keep the project simple, interpretable, and appropriate for the scope of CS50. SQLite was selected as the database because it is lightweight, requires no external setup, and is well-suited for small web applications. Flask was used as the web framework due to its simplicity and clear routing structure, making it ideal for demonstrating backend logic and server-side rendering.

The user interface was intentionally kept minimal, focusing on functionality and correctness rather than visual styling.

#### Limitations and Future Improvements:

The current categorization logic relies on keyword matching and may not correctly classify transactions with unclear or ambiguous descriptions. Future improvements could include enhanced categorization rules, visual charts for financial insights, persistent transaction history views, or support for additional file formats.

#### Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the practical application of concepts learned throughout CS50, including file I/O, functions, modular program design, SQL databases, user authentication, and web development using Flask. It solves a real-world problem while remaining clear, maintainable, and within the intended scope of the course.
